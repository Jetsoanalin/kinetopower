# kinetopower
The purpose of KINETO_POWER project is to design a mechanically powered (Human powered- Running or jogging) charger that will recharge batteries used for Charging mobile phones. The lower the rated voltage of the battery that has to be recharged, the less work the human has to do (walking) and more work (jogging) for quick power in order to recharge it. The design should be efficient and cost effective to provide a means of charging batteries to those who may not be able to afford electricity and or those who are in areas where electricity is unavailable.
